    <h1>The Rulebook</h1>
    <p>Certain cards come with certain attributes, printed on the card as either a symbol or an acronym. The following is a list of existing attributes and explanations of how they work.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>RS - Rush</h2>
    <p>This card attacks immediately on the same turn it's placed.</p>
    <h2>FL - Flying</h2>
    <p>This card ignores any opposing cards (unless they have Flying or High Block) and attacks the enemy player directly. It can also only be attacked by Flying or Reach cards.</p>
    <h2>HB - High Block</h2>
    <p>This card prevents opposing Flying cards from attacking the player directly.</p>
    <h2>RH - Reach</h2>
    <p>This card can attack opposing Flying cards.</p>
    <h2>MR - Mirror</h2>
    <p>This card will copy all attributes and statistics of the opposing card when played. It has 2 attack and 2 health if there is no opposing card.</p>
    <h2>DR - Drunk</h2>
    <p>This card's attack is randomized between 0 and 3 (inclusive) each time when it attacks.</p>
    <h2>SH - Shield</h2>
    <p>This card will ignore the first incoming damage it takes.</p>
    <h2>VH - Valiant Heart</h2>
    <p>As long as this card is on the board, all other cards on the same side gain a shield at the start of the player's turn.</p>
    <h2>MA - Marching</h2>
    <p>After attacking, this card moves to the adjacent space in a certain direction, or changes direction if there is no vacant space. The starting direction is right.</p>
    <h2>HM - Hound Master</h2>
    <p>As long as this card is on the board, the player receives a Blood Beast at the start of their turn.</p>
    <h2>HH - Headed Hunter</h2>
    <p>This card gains +1 attack for every health the player lost.</p>
    <h2>RB - Rebirth</h2>
    <p>Upon sacrificing, this card does not perish, but only loses 1 health.</p>
