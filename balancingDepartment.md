Trying more HP



From test with 25 HP
Main problem, you have the most resources at the start and then It dwindles making the game decided halfway through, and then it slows down as one player bleeds out

Main critic, almost impossible to retake board
A bit too slow, 
Reaction Cards

Result from test with 12 HP, 
way more interesting matches
Cadaver as seccond player turn 1 takes the Tempo to 11

Make RB, so you canÂ´t sacc it turn 1
Make it clearer that you can only have 4 blood
Cards left in deck counter

Look into hound master

Check if flying is too OP

Ideas, 
- Maybe tweek card cost curve
- Maybe Implement Inscryptions scale mechanic, with a larger scale
- Maybe add Bone Mechanic, or you gain one blood whenever you take 5 or more direct damage
- More 0 Cost minions
- Maybe from turn
- Make Cavader a 0/5:2
